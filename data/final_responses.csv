This past week, Brussels only got 15,000 doses. These doses are currently being distributed among seven vaccination centers in the city region, with three additional centers set to open this week. Neven said authorities will gradually lower the qualifying age until everyone 65 and up has gotten a coronavirus shot.

There is no mention of vaccines being prioritised for documented people compared to undocumented people. ,Unknown,BEL1,"Is de vaccinatie tegen COVID-19 verplicht en gratis?

In Belgium, only vaccination against polio is mandatory. All other vaccinations are highly recommended, including vaccination against COVID-19.

Waarom krijg ik niet 'het beste' vaccin?

Neen. We hebben te maken met een ongeziene situatie: op vrij korte tijd moeten miljoenen mensen worden gevaccineerd tegen het coronavirus, dat nu al meer dan een jaar de wereld in zijn ban houdt. Het is nu een race tegen de tijd, hoe sneller we vaccineren, hoe minder mensen besmet worden met het COVID-19 virus. Aan dit virus stierven in België alleen al bijna 25.000 mensen, en dagelijks overlijden er nu nog 19 aan.

Daarnaast is het aantal vaccins nog beperkt, en dat is de reden waarom mensen hun vaccin niet kunnen kiezen. De Belgische overheid moet, op een wetenschappelijk onderbouwde manier, beslissen welke vaccins het beste aan welke groepen mensen worden toegediend. Doel is om zoveel mogelijk mensen op een veilige manier optimaal te beschermen tegen het virus, dat ondertussen ook muteert en besmettelijker wordt. Alle vaccins die in België gebruikt worden zijn goedgekeurd door het Europese Geneesmiddelenagentschap op basis van kwaliteit, veiligheid en werkzaamheid.","Can I choose which vaccine I get? Why am I not getting 'the best' vaccine?

No. We are dealing with an unprecedented situation: in a relatively short period of time, millions of people have to be vaccinated against the coronavirus, which has been holding the world under its spell for more than a year now. It is now a race against time, the faster we vaccinate, the fewer people will be infected with the COVID-19 virus. Almost 25,000 people have died from this virus in Belgium alone, and 19 still die from it every day.

In addition, the number of vaccines is still limited, which is why people cannot choose their vaccine. The Belgian government must decide, in a scientifically substantiated manner, which vaccines are best administered to which groups of people. The aim is to protect as many people as possible in a safe way against the virus, which is also mutating and becoming more contagious. All vaccines used in Belgium are approved by the European Medicines Agency on the basis of quality, safety and efficacy.","This statement coming from BEL1 is answering the general question, can i choose which vaccine I can get?

Voor een optimale doeltreffendheid van het vaccin bij de bevolking en het ontstaan van groepsimmuniteit, zouden zoveel mogelijk Belgen zich moeten laten vaccineren, Groepsimmuniteit wil zeggen dat een voldoende grote groep mensen weerstand heeft opgebouwd tegen het virus, waardoor het niet meer of nog maar zeer moeilijk kan circuleren. Zo zal het virus geen kans meer krijgen om zich massaal te verspreiden en een ernstige epidemie te veroorzaken met bijhorende lockdown maatregelen. Ook zal het de personen beschermen die niet gevaccineerd kunnen worden (bv. kankerpatiënten in acute behandeling of mensen met een ernstige allergische voorgeschiedenis op vaccins -type anafylactische reactie)).

There have been warnings about scammers sending out fake invitations asking people for money in exchange for scheduling an appointment. And Belgian media reported that some invitations have gone to the wrong people.

Stát navíc hodlá za vakcinaci, třebaže není povinná, převzít odpovědnost v případně zdravotních komplikací, které by mohla způsobit. „Nemyslíme, že by k nim mělo docházet ve větším množství než u jiných vakcín. Je to garance pro občany, že se stát zaručí za bezpečnost takového postupu.“","CZE08: ""At the moment when the priority population is vaccinated, there is an interest in vaccinating as much as possible,"" Blatný emphasizes.

Celkové náklady jak na nákup očkovacích látek, tak na úhradu jednotlivých kroků z veřejného zdravotního pojištění, jsou velmi obtížně predikovatelné. Primárně se budou odvíjet od ceny a množství jednotlivých nakoupených očkovacích látek. V současné době nejsou známy základní údaje a není ani jisté, že všechny očkovací látky, které byly předběžně objednány, budou schváleny EMA k používání. Celkovou úhradu za očkovací látky lze při 60 % proočkovanosti očekávat v řádu vyšších jednotek miliard Kč. Obdobné pak mohou být náklady na samotnou aplikaci očkovací látky.

Given that the state and health insurance companies manage public funds, it is essential that there be a clear legal framework for the whole procedure through legislation and related measures and contractual arrangements.
The total costs of both the purchase of vaccines and the payment of individual steps from public health insurance are very difficult to predict. They will primarily depend on the price and quantity of each vaccine purchased. At present, the basic data are not known and it is not certain that all vaccines that have been pre-ordered will be approved by the EMA for use. The total payment for vaccines can be expected in the order of 60% vaccination in the order of higher units of billions of CZK. The cost of the vaccine application itself may be similar.

rozwiązań, tym samym przepraszam za dotychczasowy brak odpowiedzi. Wynikało to z
konieczności uregulowania powołanych kwestii i przekazania do Pana Rzecznika

Wskazując powyższe, uprzejmie informuję, że szczepienia ww. grup cudzoziemców
przebywających w Polsce odbywają się na zasadach ogólnych, wynikających
z Narodowego Programu Szczepień przeciw COVID-19. Niemniej jednak, biorąc pod
uwagę fakt, że cudzoziemcy nie posiadają numeru PESEL, nie jest możliwym
zarejestrowanie cudzoziemca poprzez system e-rejestracji. Skierowanie na szczepienie
może zostać wystawione przez lekarza na podstawie danych z dokumentu
poświadczającego tożsamość osoby. Sam proces nie różni się niczym, jak przy
wprowadzaniu nr PESEL. Różnica polega na tym, że lekarz musi wprowadzić więcej
danych (nie są one pobierane z systemów, lekarz musi ręcznie poprawnie wprowadzić
nr dokumentu, imię, nazwisko, datę urodzenia). Dane te muszą być spójne we
wszystkich dokumentach tj. e-skierowanie, kwalifikacja oraz e-karta szczepienia.
Biorąc powyższe pod uwagę, zaleca się by w celu zaszczepienia poszczególnych grup
migrantów ośrodki dla cudzoziemców nawiązały kontakt z operatorem medycznym,
z którym Urząd ds. Cudzoziemców posiada podpisaną umowę celem wystawienia
e-skierowań na szczepienia przeciw COVID-19. W tym miejscu zaznaczam, że już od
10 maja br. wszystkie osoby dorosłe mają możliwość zarejestrowania się na szczepienie.

cudzoziemców może skontaktować się z wybranym punktem szczepień, który
przeprowadzi szczepienia osób zamieszkujących dany ośrodek, celem skoordynowania
tego procesu.
Ponadto informuję, że trwają prace dotyczące minimalnego okresu pobytu jako
uprawniającego do szczepienia w Polsce i nie wykluczamy takich rozwiązań w celu
uniknięcia przekraczania granicy tylko w związku z chęcią zaszczepienia się.","The issue of foreigners residing in Poland on the basis of temporary residency permits, which are not related to type of work conducted in Poland; of people residing in Poland on the basis of visas; of people waiting for the assessment of their residency permit requests; of people who have international protection or are currently applying for such protection; has been recently subject to procedures and determination of concrete solutions, so for this reason I apologies for a lack of reply so far. The delay resulted from the need to regulate the questions being addressed here and to respond to you with the solutions adopted. 

I am therefore informing you that the vaccination of foreigners residing in Poland is happening on the basis of general rules, resulting from the National Vaccination Programme. However, taking into consideration the fact that foreigners do not have PESEL, it is not possible for them to register via the online registration system. Referrals for vaccinations can be given by doctors on the basis of the data from the identity documents which confirm the identity of the person. The process does not differ from the one which uses the PESEL number as its basis. The difference is that the doctor has to introduce more data into the system (as the data is not taken from the system, the doctor must manually and correctly introduce the number of the ID, name, surname, date of birth). That data must be compatible on all documents, e.g. e-referral, qualification or e-vaccination card. 

Taking all this into consideration, it is advised that in order to vaccinate specific groups of migrants, the refugee centres make contact with the health provider, with whom the State Agency for Foreigners has an agreement, with the aim of getting e-referrals for the vaccine against COVID-19. I am specifying here that, as of May 10, all adults have the possibility to register for a vaccine. I am additionally informing that, to facilitate the vaccination, the refugee centre can also contact a specific vaccination point, which is in charge of that centre, in order to coordinate the process. 

I am additionally informing you, that currently we are working on determining the minimum period of stay in the country which would give the right to have the vaccine here and we are not excluding such solutions, in order to avoid people crossing the border only for the purpose of getting a vaccine.
